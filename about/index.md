## Joseph Anastacio

Alii,

My name is Joseph Anastacio. I am from Palau, a small place in the Pacific between the Philippines and Guam. If you want to learn more interesting things about Palau check out Palau Visitor Authority <a href="https://www.pristineparadisepalau.com" target="_blank" > website </a>.  

I study Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. I attended the Palau Community College before transferring. In high school, I hated repetitive tasks and someone suggested I use a program to do it. Thatâ€™s pretty much how my interest was piqued and got started on programming.

Thanks for visiting!
